* Four core metrics companies in this domain use are monthly recurring revenue, customer acquisition cost, lifetime value and churn.
* Comparing the results to its competitors, Microstrategy Incorporated reported Total Revenue increase in the 1 quarter 2021 by 10.3 % year on year.
The revenue growth was below Microstrategy Incorporated's competitors average revenue growth of 28.67 %, recorded in the same quarter.

* Quickbooks & Netsuite are technologies back office service would utilize since it consists of settlements, clearances, record maintenance, regulatory compliance, accounting, and IT services.
